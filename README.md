# Water-Quality-Prediction-for-Drinking-using-Machine-Learning
Water is necessary for the survival of humans, animals, and plants. Despite its importance,
high-quality water is not always appropriate for residential, commercial or drinking purposes.
A variety of factors, such as pollution, mining operations and industrial development impacts
the quality of water by adding or changing its present parameters, thereby affecting the water's
ability for human intake or general use. The World Health Organization's specifications specify
the limits of various parameters that have to be present in water samples used for irrigation
purposes or consumption. It would become quite difficult to collect water samples from
multiple sources, determine the numerous characteristics present, and compare these metrics
to pre-established standards while following various transportation and measurement
procedures. Using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, we can identify whether water samples
are safe for irrigation and drinking. To classify the water, three machine learning models were
tested: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SV) and XG Boost. The three machine
learning models were combined with recurrent feature reduction to identify which water
parameter has the greatest impact on each model's classification accuracy.
